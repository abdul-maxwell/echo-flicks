# Video Streaming Source Information

## ⚠️ Important: TMDB API Limitation

The TMDB (The Movie Database) API **only provides metadata** such as:
- Movie/TV show information (title, description, cast, etc.)
- Poster and backdrop images
- **YouTube trailer links**

**TMDB does NOT provide actual movie/TV show streaming URLs** due to licensing and copyright restrictions.

## Current Implementation

The video player is now set up with a proper HTML5 video player with working controls:
- ✅ Play/Pause working
- ✅ Volume control working
- ✅ Fullscreen working
- ✅ Seek/scrub timeline working
- ✅ Keyboard shortcuts (Space/K for play/pause, F for fullscreen, Arrow keys to skip)
- ✅ Progress saving

However, it currently shows a **demo poster** because no actual video source is configured.

## How to Add Real Video Streaming

To stream actual movies/TV shows, you need to:

### Option 1: Use a Video Streaming Service
Integrate with services like:
- **Vimeo PRO** (for hosting your own videos)
- **JW Player** (video hosting platform)
- **Cloudflare Stream**
- **AWS S3 + CloudFront** (for self-hosted videos)

### Option 2: Use a Content Delivery API
If you have licensed content, integrate with:
- **Netflix API** (requires partnership/license)
- **Amazon Prime Video** (requires partnership)
- **Other streaming service APIs** with proper licensing

### Option 3: Self-Hosted Solution
1. Host video files on your server/CDN
2. Update the video player source in `src/components/VideoPlayer.tsx`:

```typescript
<video ref={videoRef} className="w-full h-full object-contain">
  <source src={YOUR_VIDEO_URL} type="video/mp4" />
</video>
```

## Example Integration

```typescript
// In VideoPlayer.tsx, replace:
<source src={`https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=${videoId}`} type="video/mp4" />

// With your actual video source:
<source src={`https://your-cdn.com/videos/${itemId}.mp4`} type="video/mp4" />
// OR
<source src={getStreamingUrl(itemId, mediaType)} type="video/mp4" />
```

## Legal Considerations

⚖️ **Important**: Streaming copyrighted content requires proper licensing agreements. Make sure you have:
- Legal rights to stream the content
- Proper licensing agreements with content owners
- Compliance with regional copyright laws

## Next Steps

1. Choose a video hosting/streaming solution
2. Set up your video storage and CDN
3. Update the video source URLs in the VideoPlayer component
4. Test streaming with your actual content
